// Write a function called `allCombos` that takes as its only argument an array and returns an array of arrays, each containing
// one possible permutation of the elements in the passed in array. The returned array should not contain any elements whose content
// is identical, even if in a different order. The result array should contain the permutation containing no elements, as well as the
// permutation containing all elements.

// For example:
// ['a', 'b', 'c'] ----> [[], ['a'], ['b'], ['c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a', 'c'], ['b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
